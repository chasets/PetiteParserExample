Replicate ESUG PetitParser tutorial

## Intro
Most discussion of PetitParser seems to assume that the user has a Comp Sci degree. This repo restates the tutorial given by Jan Kurs here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBOC20wvIbU&t=1405s&ab_channel=esugboard with explanation for people who want to use PetiteParser but haven't had a parser course at University. 

The sound in the video is very bad. This first draft is my notes on the tutorial.
